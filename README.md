# Alarm-Clock

The objective of our project is to implement an alarm clock using Python. 
Python consists of some very innovative libraries such as datetime and tkinter which help us to build the project using the current date and time as well as to provide a user interface to set the alarm according to the requirement in 24-hour format.

## Summary
With this project in Python, we have successfully made the Alarm Clock. 
We used the popular GUI library for rendering graphics on a display window. 
We learned how to extract the current time from the computer and to use it for manipulation using the DateTime library. 
This way we can set an alarm in the computer interface using python programming which rings with the default machine sound for Windows.
